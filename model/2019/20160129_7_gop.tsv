1	KELLY	So let's get started.	0
2	KELLY	Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room tonight.	0
3	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
4	KELLY	Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate.	0
5	KELLY	What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?	0
6	CRUZ	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.	0
7	CRUZ	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.	0
8	CRUZ	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.	0
9	CRUZ	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.	0
10	CRUZ	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.	0
11	CRUZ	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.	0
12	CRUZ	It will be fly-to country.	0
13	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
14	CRUZ	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.	0
15	CRUZ	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.	0
16	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
17	CRUZ	Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...	0
18	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
19	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20	CRUZ	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.	0
21	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
22	KELLY	The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country.	0
23	KELLY	And for six months that -- your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel.	0
24	KELLY	You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.	0
25	KELLY	But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding.	0
26	KELLY	Which is it?	0
27	CRUZ	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.	0
28	CRUZ	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.	0
29	CRUZ	I am glad Donald is running.	0
30	CRUZ	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.	0
31	CRUZ	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.	0
32	CRUZ	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.	0
33	CRUZ	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.	0
34	CRUZ	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.	0
35	CRUZ	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.	0
36	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
37	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue.	0
38	WALLACE	The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle.	0
39	WALLACE	You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP.	0
40	WALLACE	How?	0
41	RUBIO	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.	0
42	RUBIO	It's not about Donald Trump.	0
43	RUBIO	He's an entertaining guy.	0
44	RUBIO	He's the greatest show on earth.	0
45	RUBIO	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.	0
46	RUBIO	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.	0
47	RUBIO	Barack Obama wants to change America.	0
48	RUBIO	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.	0
49	RUBIO	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.	0
50	RUBIO	We want to be the United States of America.	0
51	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
52	RUBIO	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.	0
53	RUBIO	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.	0
54	RUBIO	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?	0
55	RUBIO	I don't think so.	0
56	RUBIO	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.	0
57	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
58	BAIER	Governor Bush, it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment.	0
59	BAIER	But isn't that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?	0
60	BUSH	Bret, we're just starting.	0
61	BUSH	The first vote hasn't been counted.	0
62	BUSH	Why don't we let the process work.	0
63	BUSH	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.	0
64	BUSH	I kind of miss Donald Trump.	0
65	BUSH	He was a little teddy bear to me.	0
66	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
67	BUSH	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.	0
68	BUSH	I kind of miss him.	0
69	BUSH	I wish he was here.	0
70	BUSH	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.	0
71	BUSH	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.	0
72	BUSH	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.	0
73	BUSH	Fine, I'll take it.	0
74	BUSH	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.	0
75	BUSH	I'll take that, too.	0
76	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
77	BUSH	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.	0
78	BUSH	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.	0
79	BUSH	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.	0
80	BUSH	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.	0
81	BUSH	I released 34 years of tax returns...	0
82	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
83	BUSH	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.	0
84	BUSH	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.	0
85	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
86	BAIER	Thank you governor.	0
87	KELLY	Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle.	0
88	KELLY	However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done.	0
89	KELLY	And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise.	0
90	KELLY	Why are they wrong and you're right?	0
91	CHRISTIE	They're not wrong.	0
92	CHRISTIE	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.	0
93	CHRISTIE	You can do both.	0
94	CHRISTIE	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.	0
95	CHRISTIE	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.	0
96	CHRISTIE	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.	0
97	CHRISTIE	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.	0
98	CHRISTIE	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.	0
99	CHRISTIE	And who's compromised and who is principled.	0
100	CHRISTIE	What he wants is something to get done.	0
101	CHRISTIE	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.	0
102	CHRISTIE	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.	0
103	CHRISTIE	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.	0
104	CHRISTIE	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.	0
105	CHRISTIE	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.	0
106	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
107	BAIER	Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category.	0
108	BAIER	But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.	0
109	BAIER	Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement.	0
110	BAIER	And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.	0
111	BAIER	So did you make a mistake by not fully -- more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?	0
112	PAUL	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.	0
113	PAUL	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.	0
114	PAUL	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.	0
115	PAUL	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.	0
116	PAUL	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.	0
117	PAUL	You know, Ted didn't show up.	0
118	PAUL	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.	0
119	PAUL	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.	0
120	PAUL	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.	0
121	PAUL	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.	0
122	PAUL	The NSA is another big issue.	0
123	PAUL	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.	0
124	PAUL	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.	0
125	PAUL	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.	0
126	PAUL	But we don't see it happening at all.	0
127	PAUL	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.	0
128	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
129	BAIER	Senator Cruz, your response to that?	0
130	CRUZ	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.	0
131	CRUZ	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.	0
132	CRUZ	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.	0
133	CRUZ	It didn't have the votes to pass.	0
134	CRUZ	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.	0
135	CRUZ	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.	0
136	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
137	BAIER	Senator Rubio?	0
138	RUBIO	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.	0
139	RUBIO	He believes everything he stands for.	0
140	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
141	RUBIO	I do respect Rand.	0
142	RUBIO	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.	0
143	RUBIO	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.	0
144	RUBIO	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.	0
145	RUBIO	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.	0
146	RUBIO	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.	0
147	RUBIO	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.	0
148	RUBIO	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.	0
149	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
150	BAIER	Thank you, Senator.	0
151	PAUL	May I respond?	0
152	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
153	BAIER	We'll come back to...	0
154	PAUL	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.	0
155	BAIER	OK. Go ahead, go ahead.	0
156	PAUL	Just very quickly, I would like to respond.	0
157	PAUL	The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack.	0
158	PAUL	I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.	0
159	PAUL	When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this.	0
160	PAUL	Even the court declared it to be illegal.	0
161	PAUL	If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way.	0
162	PAUL	Let's use the Fourth Amendment.	0
163	PAUL	Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it.	0
164	PAUL	Let's respect the history of our country.	0
165	PAUL	John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants.	0
166	PAUL	Let's don't forget that.	0
167	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
168	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year.	0
169	WALLACE	"You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label."	0
170	WALLACE	First question is why do you reject it?	0
171	WALLACE	And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?	0
172	KASICH	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.	0
173	KASICH	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.	0
174	KASICH	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.	0
175	KASICH	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.	1
176	KASICH	You know, the situation is this.	0
177	KASICH	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.	0
178	KASICH	We have to come together as a country.	0
179	KASICH	And we have to stop all the divisions.	0
180	KASICH	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.	0
181	KASICH	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.	0
182	KASICH	And it isn't because I'm all that great.	0
183	KASICH	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.	0
184	KASICH	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.	0
185	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
186	WALLACE	Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you.	0
187	WALLACE	Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane.	0
188	WALLACE	You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R.	0
189	WALLACE	But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?	0
190	CARSON	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.	0
191	CARSON	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.	0
192	CARSON	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.	0
193	CARSON	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...	0
194	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
195	CARSON	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.	0
196	CARSON	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.	0
197	CARSON	"We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem."	0
198	CARSON	The American people are terrified.	0
199	CARSON	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.	0
200	CARSON	We don't need more of the same solutions.	0
201	CARSON	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.	0
202	CARSON	(APPLAUSE)	0
203	WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds.	0
204	WALLACE	I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.	0
205	WALLACE	According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year.	0
206	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism.	0
207	WALLACE	You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion.	0
208	WALLACE	You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night.	0
209	WALLACE	But critics say that your record does not match up to that.	0
210	WALLACE	You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria.	0
211	WALLACE	Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.	0
212	WALLACE	How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?	0
213	CRUZ	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.	0
214	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
215	CRUZ	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.	0
216	CRUZ	It is not tough talk.	0
217	CRUZ	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.	0
218	CRUZ	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.	0
219	CRUZ	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.	0
220	CRUZ	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.	0
221	CRUZ	Today, we have about 4,000.	0
222	CRUZ	When that war began, we had 529 ships.	0
223	CRUZ	Today, we have 272.	0
224	CRUZ	You want to know what carpet bombing is?	0
225	CRUZ	"It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy."	0
226	CRUZ	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.	0
227	CRUZ	He's not arming the Kurds.	0
228	CRUZ	We need to define the enemy.	0
229	CRUZ	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.	0
230	CRUZ	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.	0
231	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
232	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric?	0
233	RUBIO	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.	0
234	RUBIO	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.	0
235	RUBIO	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.	0
236	RUBIO	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.	0
237	RUBIO	"ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides."	0
238	RUBIO	"ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria."	0
239	RUBIO	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.	0
240	RUBIO	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.	0
241	RUBIO	They are not going to go away on their own.	0
242	RUBIO	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.	0
243	RUBIO	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.	0
244	RUBIO	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.	0
245	RUBIO	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.	0
246	RUBIO	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.	0
247	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
248	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, you've got 30 seconds.	0
249	WALLACE	You were mentioned.	0
250	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
251	CRUZ	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.	0
252	CRUZ	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.	0
253	CRUZ	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.	0
254	CRUZ	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.	0
255	CRUZ	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --	0
256	WALLACE	Gentlemen.	0
257	CRUZ	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.	0
258	PAUL	My budget was mentioned.	0
259	PAUL	My budget was mentioned.	0

266	BAIER	Let's get right back to the questions.	0
267	BAIER	Chris.	0
268	WALLACE	Thank you.	0
269	WALLACE	Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President.	0
270	WALLACE	You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe.	0
271	WALLACE	Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?	0
272	CHRISTIE	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.	0
273	CHRISTIE	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.	0
274	CHRISTIE	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.	0
275	CHRISTIE	They like to ask direct questions.	0
276	CHRISTIE	And, they asked about her email situation.	0
277	CHRISTIE	And, here's what she said to the American people.	0
278	CHRISTIE	She did it for convenience.	0
279	CHRISTIE	For her convenience.	0
280	CHRISTIE	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.	0
281	CHRISTIE	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.	0
282	CHRISTIE	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.	0
283	CHRISTIE	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.	0
284	CHRISTIE	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.	0

310	WALLACE	Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we're going to conduct a debate...	0
311	BUSH	Thank you Chris...	0
312	WALLACE	Governor Bush...	0
313	CRUZ	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)	0
314	WALLACE	Governor Bush, here's the question -- I'm going to ask Governor Bush the question.	0
315	WALLACE	You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.	0
316	WALLACE	But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.	0
317	WALLACE	That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?	0
318	BUSH	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.	0
319	BUSH	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.	0
320	BUSH	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.	0
321	BUSH	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.	0
322	BUSH	Now we hear the tough talk.	0
323	BUSH	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.	0
324	BUSH	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.	0
325	BUSH	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.	0
326	BUSH	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.	0
327	BUSH	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.	0
328	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
329	BUSH	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.	0
330	BUSH	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...	0
331	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
332	BUSH	... ground and air.	0
333	BUSH	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.	0
334	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
335	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.	0
336	CRUZ	"Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, ""Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted..."""	0
337	SYSTEM	(AUDIENCE)	0
338	CRUZ	Let me just say this...	0
339	WALLACE	It is a debate, sir.	0
340	CRUZ	... Well, no, no.	0
341	CRUZ	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.	0
342	CRUZ	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.	0
343	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
344	CRUZ	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.	0
345	CRUZ	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.	0
346	CRUZ	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.	0
347	WALLACE	I think the questions were about issues.	0
348	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...	0

365	WALLACE	Good.	0
366	RUBIO	And second of all...	0
367	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
368	RUBIO	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.	0
369	RUBIO	It was against Assad.	0
370	RUBIO	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.	0
371	RUBIO	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.	0
372	RUBIO	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.	0
373	RUBIO	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...	0
374	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
375	RUBIO	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.	0
376	RUBIO	When I'm president, that will change.	0

378	WALLACE	Senator Paul, go ahead.	0
379	PAUL	Thank you.	0
380	PAUL	The issue in Syria's a very important one, and it's one we need to get right.	0
381	PAUL	The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war?	0
382	PAUL	Some want (ph) to topple Assad.	0
383	PAUL	In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.	0
384	PAUL	I think that's a really, really bad idea.	0
385	PAUL	In fact, I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.	0
386	PAUL	But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space.	0
387	PAUL	You might -- you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.	0

403	KELLY	No, no.	0
404	KELLY	No.	0
405	KASICH	...the only reason is -- look...	0
406	KELLY	No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why we're partnering with Google on this debate, and they're telling us...	0
407	KASICH	OK.	0
408	KELLY	... that their search results have gone through the roof on -- on people...	0
409	KASICH	I've always listened to you, Megyn.	0
410	KASICH	Go ahead.	0
411	KELLY	... you're a good man, Governor Kasich.	0
412	KASICH	Yes -- thank you.	0
413	KELLY	People -- the search results -- the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.	0
414	KELLY	People are worried.	0
415	KELLY	They're worried about what's happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know.	0
416	KELLY	Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you've advocated closing down mosques -- we'll get back to you.	0
417	KELLY	Well, you have advocated closing down -- closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring.	0
418	KELLY	You told me that.	0
419	KELLY	But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.	0
420	KELLY	In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror.	0
421	KELLY	Doesn't your position run afoul of the First Amendment?	0
422	RUBIO	Megyn, that's the problem.	0
423	RUBIO	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.	0
424	RUBIO	It's hate action.	0
425	RUBIO	They blow people up.	0
426	RUBIO	Look what they did in San Bernardino.	0
427	RUBIO	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.	1
428	RUBIO	"He told the police, ""I did it because I was inspired by ISIS,"" and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror."	1
429	RUBIO	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.	0
430	RUBIO	There has never been a jihadist group like this.	0
431	RUBIO	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.	0
432	RUBIO	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.	0
433	RUBIO	We must keep America safe from this threat.	0
434	RUBIO	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.	0
435	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
436	PAUL	(inaudible).	0
437	KELLY	Senator Paul, do you agree with that?	0
438	KELLY	We're gonna close down mosques, we're gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking's (ph) occurring?	0
439	KELLY	(CROSSTALK)	0
440	PAUL	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.	0
441	PAUL	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.	0
442	PAUL	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.	0
443	PAUL	"When he brought forward the ""Gang of Eight"" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us."	0
444	PAUL	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.	0
445	PAUL	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.	0
446	PAUL	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.	0
447	PAUL	You can't be in favor of defend us...	0
448	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
449	PAUL	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.	0
450	RUBIO	Might I respond?	0
451	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
452	RUBIO	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.	0
453	RUBIO	I think we all support that.	0
454	RUBIO	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.	0
455	RUBIO	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.	0
456	RUBIO	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...	0
457	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
458	RUBIO	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.	0
459	KELLY	Governor Christie, let's talk about profiling.	0
460	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
461	KELLY	In December...	0
462	CHRISTIE	Talk about what?	0
463	CHRISTIE	I...	0
464	KELLY	... profiling.	0
465	KELLY	Profiling.	0
466	KELLY	In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.	0
467	KELLY	Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.	0
468	KELLY	Now, you have said that we should not profile.	0
469	KELLY	How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?	0
470	CHRISTIE	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.	0
471	CHRISTIE	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.	0
472	CHRISTIE	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.	0
473	CHRISTIE	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.	0
474	CHRISTIE	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.	0
475	KELLY	They didn't know they were going to attack the country.	0
476	CHRISTIE	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.	0
477	CHRISTIE	They knew that.	0
478	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
479	KELLY	That's not true.	0
480	KELLY	The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage.	0
481	KELLY	They saw packages being delivered.	0
482	KELLY	They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops.	0
483	KELLY	Do you?	0
484	CHRISTIE	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.	0
485	CHRISTIE	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.	0
486	CHRISTIE	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.	0
487	CHRISTIE	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.	0
488	CHRISTIE	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.	0
489	CHRISTIE	That's what should be done.	0
490	CHRISTIE	That can be done.	0
491	CHRISTIE	That can be done without profiling people.	0
492	CHRISTIE	What that is, is just common sense.	0
493	CHRISTIE	They thought something was wrong.	0
494	CHRISTIE	And here's the problem in this country right now.	0
495	CHRISTIE	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.	0
496	CHRISTIE	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.	0
497	CHRISTIE	It's making...	0
498	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
499	CHRISTIE	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.	0
500	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
501	CHRISTIE	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.	0

504	KELLY	Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children.	0
505	KELLY	Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country.	0
506	KELLY	Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?	0
507	CARSON	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.	0
508	CARSON	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.	0
509	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
510	CARSON	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.	0
511	CARSON	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.	0
512	CARSON	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.	0
513	CARSON	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.	0
514	CARSON	If they want to accept our values and our laws.	0
515	CARSON	If not, they can stay where they are.	0
516	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
517	KELLY	Governor Kasich, stand back.	0
518	KELLY	You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking.	0
519	KELLY	And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.	0
520	KELLY	Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too.	0
521	KELLY	And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans.	0
522	KELLY	Are they wrong?	0
523	KASICH	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.	0
524	KASICH	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.	0
525	KASICH	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.	0
526	MEGYN	But this is public testimony.	0
527	KASICH	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.	0
528	KASICH	Now I want to go back something.	0
529	KASICH	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.	0
530	KASICH	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.	0
531	KASICH	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.	0
532	KASICH	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.	0
533	KASICH	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.	0
534	KASICH	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.	0
535	KASICH	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.	0
536	KASICH	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.	0
537	KASICH	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.	0
538	KASICH	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.	0
539	KASICH	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.	0
540	KASICH	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.	0
541	KASICH	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.	0
542	KASICH	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.	0
543	KASICH	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.	0

546	BAIER	Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences.	0
547	BAIER	So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.	0
548	BAIER	If you were president.	0
549	BAIER	would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets?	0
550	BUSH	Of course.	0
551	BUSH	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.	0
552	BUSH	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.	0
553	BUSH	That's his first responsibility.	0
554	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
555	BUSH	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.	0
556	BUSH	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.	0
557	BUSH	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.	0
558	BUSH	People died, and only three people have been fired.	0
559	BUSH	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.	0
560	BUSH	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.	0
561	BUSH	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.	0
562	BUSH	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.	0
563	BUSH	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.	0
564	BUSH	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.	0
565	BAIER	Governor Bush, thank you.	0
566	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
567	BAIER	Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators.	0

569	BAIER	And here's one of them.	0
570	QUESTION	I'm Mark Watson.	0
571	QUESTION	I'm known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but I'm also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.	0
572	QUESTION	As an African-American living near Ferguson, I've seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand.	0
573	QUESTION	Now, there are great tools like body cameras that -- to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts.	0
574	QUESTION	Why aren't we using the technology available to better protect our communities?	0
575	BAIER	Senator Paul, that question to you.	0
576	PAUL	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.	0
577	PAUL	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.	0
578	PAUL	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.	0
579	PAUL	People were just being fined to death.	0
580	PAUL	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.	0
581	PAUL	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.	0
582	PAUL	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.	0
583	PAUL	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.	0
584	PAUL	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.	0
585	PAUL	I think something has to change.	0
586	PAUL	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.	0

596	KELLY	Welcome back, everybody.	0
597	KELLY	We are live in Des Moines, Iowa.	0
598	KELLY	And let's get right back to the questions -- Bret.	0
599	BAIER	Thank you, Megyn.	0
600	BAIER	Gentlemen, I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government.	0
601	BAIER	Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn't ever materialize.	0
602	BAIER	We all know that.	0
603	BAIER	Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget.	0
604	BAIER	But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?	0
605	CHRISTIE	Yes.	0
606	CHRISTIE	You want one?	0
607	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
608	BAIER	I want one.	0
609	BAIER	Yes.	0
610	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
611	CHRISTIE	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.	0
612	CHRISTIE	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.	0
613	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
614	BAIER	Anything bigger than that?	0
615	CHRISTIE	Bigger than that?	0
616	CHRISTIE	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.	0
617	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
618	BAIER	And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you're not alone.	0
619	BAIER	"Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched ""policy repeals,"" that there were a lot of them."	0
620	BAIER	Obamacare took the top two spots.	0
621	BAIER	But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.	0
622	BAIER	So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance?	0
623	BAIER	And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?	0
624	CRUZ	Sure.	0
625	CRUZ	Well, let's take it one at a time.	0
626	CRUZ	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.	1
627	CRUZ	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.	1
628	CRUZ	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.	1
629	CRUZ	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
630	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
631	CRUZ	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.	0
632	CRUZ	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.	0
633	CRUZ	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.	0
634	CRUZ	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.	0
635	CRUZ	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.	0
636	CRUZ	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.	0
637	CRUZ	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.	0
638	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.	1
639	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
640	BAIER	Senator Cruz, thank you.	0
641	BAIER	Governor Bush, you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico.	0
642	BAIER	The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden.	0
643	BAIER	Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed.	0
644	BAIER	So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?	0
645	BUSH	No, they shouldn't.	0
646	BUSH	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.	0
647	BUSH	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.	0
648	BUSH	They serve in the military.	0
649	BUSH	They would have to pay federal taxes.	0
650	BUSH	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.	0
651	BUSH	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.	0
652	BUSH	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.	0
653	BUSH	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.	0
654	BUSH	And a lot of people are doing that.	0
655	BUSH	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.	0
656	BUSH	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.	0
657	BAIER	Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race.	0
658	BAIER	Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire -- he and his administration -- for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it.	0
659	BAIER	How would you have handled that?	0
660	KASICH	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.	0
661	KASICH	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.	0
662	KASICH	"I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable."	0
663	KASICH	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.	0
664	KASICH	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.	0
665	KASICH	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.	0
666	KASICH	You've got to be on top of it.	0
667	KASICH	You've got to go the extra mile.	0
668	KASICH	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.	0
669	KASICH	Because you realize that people depending on you.	0
670	KASICH	And so, you go the extra mile.	0
671	KASICH	But people have to be alert.	0
672	KASICH	They have to be alert to problems.	0
673	KASICH	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.	0
674	KASICH	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.	0
675	KASICH	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.	0
676	KASICH	So the fact is that we work for the people.	0
677	KASICH	The people don't work for us.	0
678	KASICH	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.	0
679	KASICH	That's what really matters.	0
680	KASICH	We serve you.	0
681	KASICH	You don't serve us.	0
682	KASICH	We listen to you and -- and then we act.	0
683	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
684	BAIER	Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy.	0
685	BAIER	Now, you're a skeptic of climate change science.	0
686	BAIER	And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.	0
687	BAIER	So why the change?	0
688	RUBIO	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.	0
689	RUBIO	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.	0
690	RUBIO	And I opposed it.	0
691	RUBIO	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.	0
692	RUBIO	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.	0
693	RUBIO	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.	0
694	RUBIO	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.	0
695	RUBIO	And I was clear about that at the time.	0
696	RUBIO	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.	0
697	RUBIO	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.	0
698	RUBIO	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.	0
699	RUBIO	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.	0
700	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
701	BAIER	Thanks, Senator.	0
702	KELLY	All right.	0
703	KELLY	We're going to move on.	0
704	KELLY	Because coming up, immigration, and something you've never seen before.	0
705	KELLY	Stay tuned, right after this break.	0
706	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
707	KELLY	Welcome back everyone.	0
708	KELLY	Live, in Des Moines, Iowa.	0
709	KELLY	Now, we move onto the topic of immigration.	0
710	KELLY	Senator Rubio, we'll start with you.	0
711	KELLY	When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants.	0
712	KELLY	You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S.	0
713	KELLY	Senator as well.	0
714	KELLY	Here are just a few examples.	0
715	KELLY	Watch.	0
716	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
717	RUBIO	Never support.	0
718	RUBIO	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.	0
719	SYSTEM	(END VIDEO CLIP)	0
720	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
721	RUBIO	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.	0
722	RUBIO	It's what they call it.	0
723	RUBIO	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.	0
724	SYSTEM	(END VIDEO CLIP)	0
725	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
726	RUBIO	You cannot grant amnesty.	0
727	RUBIO	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.	0
728	RUBIO	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.	0
729	SYSTEM	(END VIDEO CLIP)	0
730	KELLY	Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty.	1
731	KELLY	Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?	0
732	RUBIO	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.	0
733	RUBIO	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...	1
734	KELLY	But, you went on from there...	0
735	RUBIO	I do not support amnesty...	1
736	KELLY	... You said more than that, Senator...	0
737	RUBIO	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...	1
738	KELLY	... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.	1
739	KELLY	You...	0
740	RUBIO	It was...	0
741	KELLY	... supported earned path to citizenship...	0
742	RUBIO	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.	1
743	RUBIO	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.	0
744	RUBIO	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.	0
745	RUBIO	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.	0
746	RUBIO	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.	0
747	RUBIO	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.	0
748	RUBIO	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.	0
749	RUBIO	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.	0
750	RUBIO	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.	0
751	RUBIO	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.	0
752	RUBIO	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.	0
753	RUBIO	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.	0
754	RUBIO	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.	0
755	RUBIO	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.	0
756	RUBIO	There will be a process.	0
757	RUBIO	We will see what the American people are willing to support.	0
758	RUBIO	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.	0
759	KELLY	Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?	0
760	BUSH	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.	0
761	BUSH	I mean, that's a fact.	0
762	BUSH	And he asked me to support that.	0
763	BUSH	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.	0
764	BUSH	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.	0
765	BUSH	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.	0
766	BUSH	Here's what I believe.	0
767	BUSH	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.	0
768	BUSH	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.	0
769	BUSH	It's not a bestseller.	0
770	BUSH	I can promise you.	0
771	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
772	BUSH	There won't be any -- you can get it.	0
773	BUSH	It's affordable for everybody.	0
774	BUSH	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.	0
775	BUSH	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.	0
776	BUSH	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.	0
777	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
778	BUSH	I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.	0
779	RUBIO	May I respond?	0
780	KELLY	Go ahead, senator.	0
781	RUBIO	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.	0
782	RUBIO	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.	0
783	BUSH	So did you.	0
784	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
785	RUBIO	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...	0
786	BUSH	Yeah.	0
787	BUSH	So did you, Marco.	0
788	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
789	RUBIO	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.	0
790	RUBIO	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.	0
791	RUBIO	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.	0
792	RUBIO	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.	0
793	RUBIO	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.	0
794	BUSH	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.	0
795	BUSH	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.	0
796	BUSH	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.	0
797	BUSH	A bipartisan approach got close.	0
798	BUSH	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.	0
799	BUSH	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.	0
800	BUSH	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.	0
801	BUSH	There's never going do be perfect bill.	0
802	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
803	KELLY	All right.	0
804	BUSH	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.	0
805	RUBIO	But Megyn...	0
806	BUSH	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.	0
807	BUSH	He cut and run.	0
808	BUSH	And that's a tragedy because now...	0
809	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
810	BUSH	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.	0
811	KELLY	All right.	0
812	KELLY	This will be the last one.	0
813	RUBIO	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.	0
814	RUBIO	That is abundantly clear.	0
815	RUBIO	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.	0
816	RUBIO	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.	0
817	RUBIO	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.	0
818	KELLY	OK. Let's move on.	0
819	KELLY	Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment.	0
820	KELLY	It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship.	0
821	KELLY	Yes, it would.	0
822	KELLY	Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn't.	0
823	KELLY	Right?	0
824	KELLY	Like you just did.	0
825	KELLY	Saw that.	0
826	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
827	KELLY	You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through.	0
828	KELLY	But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time.	0
829	KELLY	Watch.	0
830	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
831	CRUZ	I want this bill to be voted down.	0
832	CRUZ	I don't want immigration reform to fail.	0
833	CRUZ	I want immigration reform to pass.	0
834	CRUZ	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.	0
835	CRUZ	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.	0
836	CRUZ	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.	0
837	CRUZ	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.	0
838	CRUZ	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.	0
839	KELLY	Was that all an act?	0
840	KELLY	It was pretty convincing.	0
841	CRUZ	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.	0
842	CRUZ	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.	0
843	CRUZ	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.	1
844	CRUZ	It didn't say a word about legalization.	1
845	CRUZ	I introduced...	0
846	KELLY	But the bill allowed both.	1
847	KELLY	The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.	1
848	CRUZ	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.	0
849	CRUZ	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.	0
850	CRUZ	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.	0
851	CRUZ	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.	0
852	CRUZ	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.	0
853	CRUZ	Listen, we can solve immigration.	0
854	CRUZ	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.	0
855	CRUZ	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.	0
856	CRUZ	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...	0
857	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
858	CRUZ	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.	0
859	CRUZ	We can build the fence.	0
860	CRUZ	We can triple the border patrol.	0
861	CRUZ	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...	0
862	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
863	CRUZ	... funding to them.	0
864	CRUZ	We can end welfare for those here illegally.	0
865	CRUZ	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.	0
866	CRUZ	If I am elected president...	0
867	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
868	CRUZ	... we will secure the border...	0
869	KELLY	OK, sir.	0
870	CRUZ	... and we will end the illegal immigration.	0
871	KELLY	Senator Paul.	0
872	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
873	KELLY	You know how Washington works.	0
874	KELLY	Do you buy that?	0
875	PAUL	I was there and I saw the debate.	0
876	PAUL	"I saw Ted Cruz say, ""we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."""	0
877	PAUL	The bill would involve legalization.	0
878	PAUL	He can't have it both ways.	0
879	PAUL	"But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, ""you're for amnesty."""	0
880	PAUL	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.	0
881	PAUL	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.	0
882	PAUL	I was for legalization.	0
883	PAUL	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.	0
884	PAUL	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.	0
885	PAUL	That's not true.	0
886	KELLY	Go ahead, sir.	0
887	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
888	CRUZ	"You know, John Adams famously said, ""facts are are stubborn things."""	0
889	CRUZ	The facts are are very, very simple.	0
890	CRUZ	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.	0
891	CRUZ	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.	0
892	CRUZ	"And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, ""if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed""."	0

952	KELLY	Watch.	0
953	QUESTION	I'm Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl.	0
954	QUESTION	Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.	0
955	QUESTION	There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country.	0
956	QUESTION	If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?	0
957	KELLY	Dr. Carson, that's one -- that one's for you.	0
958	CARSON	Oh, great.	0
959	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
960	CARSON	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.	0
961	CARSON	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.	0
962	CARSON	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.	0
963	CARSON	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.	0
964	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
965	BUSH	Can I -- can I -- I just...	0
966	KELLY	Go ahead.	0
967	BUSH	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.	0
968	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
969	BUSH	And we should be a welcoming nation.	0
970	BUSH	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.	0
971	BUSH	That's American citizenship.	0
972	BUSH	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.	0
973	BUSH	That's what we believe in.	0
974	BUSH	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.	0
975	RUBIO	And I think that's the false choice...	0
976	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
977	RUBIO	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.	0
978	RUBIO	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.	0
979	RUBIO	By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.	0
980	RUBIO	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.	0
981	RUBIO	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.	0
982	RUBIO	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?	0
983	RUBIO	And that's not what's happening now.	0
984	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
985	KELLY	All right.	0
986	RUBIO	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.	0
987	RUBIO	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.	0
988	RUBIO	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.	0

997	WALLACE	You -- twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it.	0

1003	CRUZ	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.	0
1004	CRUZ	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.	0
1005	CRUZ	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.	0
1006	CRUZ	Washington is broken.	0
1007	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things	tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.	0

1010	KELLY	Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton.	0
1011	KELLY	Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.	0
1012	KELLY	Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.	0
1013	KELLY	Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?	0
1014	BUSH	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.	0
1015	BUSH	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.	0
1016	BUSH	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.	0
1017	BUSH	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.	0
1018	BUSH	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.	0
1019	BUSH	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.	0
1020	BUSH	The simple fact is, we all have a record.	0
1021	BUSH	It all will be scrutinized.	0
1022	BUSH	There's give and take.	0
1023	BUSH	It's called the politics.	0
1024	BUSH	And that's the way it is.	0
1025	BUSH	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.	0

1027	BAIER	Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?	0
1028	RUBIO	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.	0
1029	RUBIO	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.	0
1030	RUBIO	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.	0
1031	RUBIO	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.	1
1032	RUBIO	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.	0
1033	RUBIO	That would be a disaster for this country.	0
1034	RUBIO	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.	0
1035	SYSTEM	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)	0
1036	BAIER	Now let's talk about electability, Senator.	0
1037	BAIER	"TIME magazine once called you ""the Republican savior."""	0
1038	BAIER	Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.	0
1039	BAIER	But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you're in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points.	0
1040	BAIER	If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?	0
1041	RUBIO	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.	0
1042	RUBIO	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.	0
1043	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1044	RUBIO	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.	0
1045	RUBIO	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.	0
1046	RUBIO	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?	0
1047	RUBIO	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.	0
1048	RUBIO	It better not be Bernie Sanders.	0

1057	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1058	RUBIO	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.	0
1059	RUBIO	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.	0

1063	WALLACE	"Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the ""Bridge-gate"" case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge."	0
1064	WALLACE	Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal.	0
1065	WALLACE	Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?	0
1066	CHRISTIE	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.	0
1067	CHRISTIE	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.	0
1068	CHRISTIE	And that's what you expect from a leader.	0
1069	CHRISTIE	And, I'll tell you something else.	0
1070	CHRISTIE	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.	0
1071	CHRISTIE	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.	0
1072	CHRISTIE	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.	0
1073	CHRISTIE	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?	0
1074	CHRISTIE	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.	0
1075	CHRISTIE	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.	0
1076	CHRISTIE	I will be ready.	0
1077	CHRISTIE	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.	0

1086	KELLY	Chris?	0
1087	WALLACE	Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I'd like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.	0
1088	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith.	0
1089	WALLACE	In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.	0
1090	WALLACE	Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you're getting in and he isn't?	0
1091	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1092	KASICH	No.	0
1093	KASICH	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.	0
1094	KASICH	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.	0
1095	KASICH	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.	0
1096	KASICH	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.	0
1097	KASICH	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill.	0
1098	KASICH	"Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms."	0
1099	KASICH	How has it worked?	0
1100	KASICH	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.	1
1101	KASICH	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.	0
1102	KASICH	The mentally ill?	0
1103	KASICH	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.	0
1104	KASICH	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.	0
1105	KASICH	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.	0
1106	KASICH	But what -- I will tell you this.	0
1107	KASICH	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.	0
1108	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1109	KASICH	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.	0
1110	KASICH	Give people a chance.	0
1111	KASICH	We talked about criminal justice reform.	0
1112	KASICH	We've enacted it in our state.	0
1113	KASICH	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.	0
1114	KASICH	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.	0
1115	KASICH	And that is what we have done in Ohio.	0
1116	KASICH	We're running surpluses.	0
1117	KASICH	We're up 400,000 jobs.	0
1118	KASICH	And guess what?	0
1119	KASICH	The formula is working.	0
1120	KASICH	I'd suggest people take a look at it.	0
1121	KASICH	Thank you.	0
1122	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1123	WALLACE	Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer.	0
1124	WALLACE	A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.	0
1125	WALLACE	Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience.	0
1126	WALLACE	But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.	0
1127	CHRISTIE	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.	0
1128	CHRISTIE	And that someone in that office has to do their job.	0
1129	CHRISTIE	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.	0
1130	CHRISTIE	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.	0
1131	CHRISTIE	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.	0
1132	CHRISTIE	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.	0
1133	CHRISTIE	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.	0
1134	CHRISTIE	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.	0
1135	CHRISTIE	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.	0
1136	CHRISTIE	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.	0
1137	CHRISTIE	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.	0
1138	CHRISTIE	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.	0
1139	CHRISTIE	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.	0
1140	CHRISTIE	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.	0
1141	CHRISTIE	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.	0
1142	CHRISTIE	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.	0
1143	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1144	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.	0
1145	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.	0
1146	WALLACE	"He said you're wrong on the facts and you can't, quote, ""slime your way to the White House."""	0
1147	WALLACE	I assume in the last two weeks, you've done some fact-checking.	0
1148	WALLACE	Do you want to take anything back?	0
1149	RUBIO	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.	0
1150	RUBIO	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.	0
1151	RUBIO	And I think this is an important question.	0
1152	RUBIO	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.	0
1153	RUBIO	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?	0
1154	RUBIO	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?	0
1155	RUBIO	It is not because of the tax writeoff.	0
1156	RUBIO	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.	0
1157	RUBIO	This is what's made our nation so special.	0
1158	RUBIO	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.	0
1159	RUBIO	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.	0
1160	RUBIO	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.	0
1161	RUBIO	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.	0
1162	RUBIO	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.	0
1163	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1164	WALLACE	Thank you, senator.	0
1165	WALLACE	Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn't get into politics to fight about abortion.	0
1166	WALLACE	You said you were more concerned about the national debt.	0
1167	WALLACE	Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.	0
1168	WALLACE	Does that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?	0
1169	PAUL	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.	0
1170	PAUL	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.	0
1171	PAUL	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.	0
1172	PAUL	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.	0
1173	PAUL	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.	0
1174	PAUL	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.	0
1175	PAUL	There's a lot packed into that statement.	0
1176	PAUL	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.	0
1177	PAUL	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.	0
1178	PAUL	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.	0
1179	PAUL	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.	0
1180	WALLLACE	Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...	0
1181	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1182	WALLACE	Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question.	0
1183	WALLACE	Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice?	0
1184	WALLACE	Yes or no?	0
1185	PAUL	Both.	0
1186	PAUL	No, both the federal and a state approach.	0
1187	PAUL	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.	0
1188	PAUL	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.	0
1189	PAUL	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.	0
1190	PAUL	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.	0
1191	PAUL	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.	0
1192	PAUL	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.	0
1193	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.	0

1195	BAIER	Gentlemen.	0
1196	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1197	BAIER	I'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.	0
1198	BAIER	Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine.	0
1199	BAIER	Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia.	0
1200	BAIER	Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all.	0
1201	BAIER	What do you do?	0
1202	CARSON	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.	0
1203	CARSON	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.	0
1204	CARSON	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.	0
1205	CARSON	We only have one or two.	0
1206	CARSON	We need much more than that.	0
1207	CARSON	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.	0
1208	CARSON	They're terrified by the saber rattling.	0
1209	CARSON	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.	0
1210	CARSON	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country oil and energy.	0
1211	CARSON	And we ought to fight them on that level.	0
1212	CARSON	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.	0
1213	CARSON	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.	0
1214	CARSON	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.	0
1215	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1216	BAIER	Gentlemen, you've all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.	0
1217	BAIER	Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one.	0
1218	BAIER	But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars -- tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.	0
1219	BAIER	The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal.	0
1220	BAIER	So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran.	0
1221	BAIER	So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?	0
1222	RUBIO	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.	0
1223	RUBIO	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.	0
1224	RUBIO	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.	0
1225	RUBIO	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.	0
1226	RUBIO	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.	0
1227	RUBIO	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.	0
1228	RUBIO	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.	0
1229	RUBIO	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.	0
1230	BAIER	Governor Kasich, you've said that Marco Rubio is wrong...	0
1231	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1232	BAIER	... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.	0
1233	KASICH	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.	0
1234	KASICH	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.	0
1235	KASICH	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.	0
1236	KASICH	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.	0
1237	KASICH	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.	0
1238	KASICH	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.	0
1239	KASICH	We need to move aggressively now.	0
1240	KASICH	But I would say this to you, Bret.	0
1241	KASICH	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.	0
1242	KASICH	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.	0
1243	KASICH	That is what we have to do.	0
1244	KASICH	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.	0
1245	BAIER	But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.	0
1246	KASICH	That's right.	0
1247	KASICH	Yes.	0
1248	BAIER	And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.	0
1249	KASICH	I know, Bret.	0
1250	BAIER	They don't want...	0
1251	KASICH	But Bret, here's the problem.	0
1252	KASICH	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.	0
1253	KASICH	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.	0
1254	KASICH	"I said, ""how's it going?"""	0
1255	KASICH	"He said, ""we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we'd ever see it."""	0
1256	KASICH	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.	0
1257	KASICH	The Turks are being threatened.	0
1258	KASICH	We know about the French.	0
1259	KASICH	We know about the Belgians.	0
1260	KASICH	We know about the Brits.	0
1261	KASICH	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.	0
1262	KASICH	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...	0
1263	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1264	KASICH	... and say there is something more important than money.	0
1265	KASICH	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.	0
1266	KASICH	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.	0
1267	KASICH	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.	0
1268	KASICH	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.	0
1269	BAIER	Governor, thank you.	0
1270	BAIER	Governor Christie...	0
1271	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1272	BAIER	... Libya is the newest base for ISIS.	0
1273	BAIER	Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.	0
1274	BAIER	So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?	0
1275	CHRISTIE	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.	0
1276	CHRISTIE	"In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, ""what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"""	0
1277	CHRISTIE	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.	0
1278	CHRISTIE	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.	0
1279	CHRISTIE	Here's what I'd do.	0
1280	CHRISTIE	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.	0
1281	CHRISTIE	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.	0
1282	CHRISTIE	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.	0

1291	BAIER	Let's resume the debate.	0
1292	BAIER	Megyn?	0
1293	KELLY	Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton's history with women is fair game in this campaign.	0
1294	KELLY	How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?	0
1295	PAUL	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.	0
1296	PAUL	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.	0
1297	PAUL	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.	0
1298	PAUL	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.	0
1299	PAUL	They would never be hired again.	0
1300	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1301	PAUL	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.	0
1302	PAUL	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.	0
1303	PAUL	So it is difficult.	0
1304	KELLY	Of her husband's?	0
1305	PAUL	Yeah.	0
1306	PAUL	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.	0
1307	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1308	WALLACE	We have another question from one of Youtube's top creators.	0
1309	WALLACE	Here it is.	0
1310	QUESTION	I'm Nabela Noor.	0
1311	QUESTION	I'm a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.	0
1312	QUESTION	In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I've seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims.	0
1313	QUESTION	This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.	0
1314	QUESTION	As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?	0
1315	WALLACE	Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?	0
1316	BUSH	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.	0
1317	BUSH	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...	0
1318	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1319	BUSH	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.	0
1320	BUSH	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.	0
1321	BUSH	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.	0
1322	BUSH	She wants to pursue the American dream.	0
1323	BUSH	She's an American citizen.	0
1324	BUSH	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.	0
1325	BUSH	She's not the threat.	0
1326	BUSH	The threat is Islamic terrorism.	0
1327	BUSH	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.	0
1328	BUSH	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.	0
1329	BUSH	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.	0
1330	BUSH	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.	0
1331	BUSH	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.	0
1332	BUSH	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.	0
1333	BUSH	Making fun of disabled people...	0
1334	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
1335	BUSH	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.	0

1337	WALLACE	Governor, thank you.	0
1338	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, change of subject.	0
1339	WALLACE	You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline.	0
1340	WALLACE	As you well know, ethanol's a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.	0
1341	WALLACE	Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...	0
1342	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1343	WALLACE	... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you're bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you.	0
1344	WALLACE	Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?	0
1345	CRUZ	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.	0
1346	CRUZ	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.	0
1347	CRUZ	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.	0
1348	CRUZ	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.	0
1349	CRUZ	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.	0
1350	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1351	CRUZ	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.	0
1352	CRUZ	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.	0
1353	CRUZ	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.	0
1354	CRUZ	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.	0
1355	CRUZ	It's not true.	0
1356	CRUZ	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.	0
1357	CRUZ	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.	0
1358	CRUZ	I will...	0
1359	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGING)	0
1360	CRUZ	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.	0
1361	CRUZ	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.	0
1362	CRUZ	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.	0
1363	CRUZ	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.	0
1364	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1365	WALLACE	Dr. Carson, I'd like to ask you about exactly that issue.	0
1366	WALLACE	Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question.	0
1367	WALLACE	Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?	0
1368	CARSON	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?	0
1369	CARSON	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?	0
1370	CARSON	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.	0
1371	CARSON	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.	0
1372	CARSON	This is absolutely absurd.	0
1373	CARSON	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.	0
1374	CARSON	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.	0
1375	CARSON	People have invested a lot of energy into that.	0
1376	CARSON	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.	0
1377	CARSON	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).	0
1378	CARSON	What about hydroelectric power?	0
1379	CARSON	We can develop that, you know?	0
1380	CARSON	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.	0
1381	CARSON	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.	0
1382	CARSON	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.	0
1383	CARSON	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.	0
